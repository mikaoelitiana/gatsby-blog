Docker is one of today's best developer tools because of it's power and popularity. We are used to manage our containers through the console commands and we have the docker hub to search through accessible repositories. To make using docker even easier, they are now working on a GUI to manage docker containers. It becomes really trivial to find a container, download, configure and launch or stop it through the UI. It's named [Kitematic](https://kitematic.com) and it's in beta state as I write this post. I have tried Kitematic for a few days now and I find it really helpful. It provides an easy way to browse docker hub and download the containers I am looking for. After download, I can set configurations for the container like ports, volume folders. I can also set environment variables for each container. Launching a mongo or redis instance become as easy as pressing a "Play" button. The interface is really clean and intuitive so user from any level can use it. The log of each container is also displayed so it is easy to identify problems and debug them.

It became one of the tools I use on a daily basis on different projects.  To get it, just go to [https://kitematic.com](https://kitematic.com). Here is a quick overview of the tool :
