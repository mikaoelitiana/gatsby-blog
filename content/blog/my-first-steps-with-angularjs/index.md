After singing along with the Flatlanders family (video above), I started my first steps with AngularJS, THE framework of the moment :) . AngularJS was launched a few time ago and he is more and more used in web applications, especially for single-page one. I began to be really interested to know more about this framework and see why it is so popular. There are so many resources available online to learn it but I started with [Shaping Up With AngularJS](http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js/) from CodeShcool. They teach AngularJS in a very simple way : the instructor gives a brief explanation of a concept and the user can practice it through a set of challenges, directly in his browser. I learned the basics of AngularJS and I can now write my own app using it. I hope you will enjoy this course as much as I did.   _\* Image copyright Jason Nelson http://www.freeimages.com/photo/the-first-steps-3-1345590_
