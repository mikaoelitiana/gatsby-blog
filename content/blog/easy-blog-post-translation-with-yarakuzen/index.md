I am running a bilingual blog and I have recently discover [Yarakuzen](https://www.yarakuzen.com). This is an innovative tool for text translation and they offer a free plan for personnal use. They also have premium plans for an extensive use. This app is not like other translation tool but offers the ability to adjust translation as I want and save them. The more I translate my content, the more it become accurate and customized for my taste. So to use it on my wordpress blog, I had to create an account [here](https://app.yarakuzen.com/wordpress) and generate and API key. I also downloaded the [Yarakuzen wordpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/yarakuzen/) than is perfectly integrated to Wordpress. The plugin will ask for a public and a private key I get from my Yarakuzen account : ![YarakuZen ‹ Mika A. — WordPress](./YarakuZen-‹-Mika-A.-—-WordPress-1-300x188.png) Now, when I start a new post, I see a new box from the Yarakuzen plugin, it allows me to send my post content to Yarakuzen for translation. ![Ajouter un nouvel article ‹ Mika A. — WordPress](./Ajouter-un-nouvel-article-‹-Mika-A.-—-WordPress-1-300x234.png) This is how I use it :

*   I create my first post in any language (say english) and save it
*   I create another post for translation and paste content from source post
*   I send translation to Yarakuzen through the box and when ready
*   I click the "Retrieve translation" button from the Yarakuzen box

![retrieve](./retrieve-1-300x119.png) This will replace my content with the translated text and it will also keep medias so I don't need to add them again in the translation. This is a service that is really helpful for me and I will use really often. You can learn more about Yarakuzen and their plans and services in [yarakuzen.com](http://yarakuzen.com)
